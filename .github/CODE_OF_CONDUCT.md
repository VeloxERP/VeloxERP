# VeloxERP Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the VeloxERP project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We are committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Accepting constructive feedback gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and any form of unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information (e.g., physical or electronic addresses) without explicit permission.
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the VeloxERP project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [report@spookly.net]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Detailed enforcement policies and procedures may be provided separately as needed.

Project maintainers who fail to enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the project's leadership.
